# NVDA Stock Predictor üìà

This project uses an **LSTM-based Machine Learning model** to predict whether **NVIDIA's (NVDA) stock price** will go **up or down tomorrow**.  
The prediction leverages historical data from **NVDA** as well as correlated stocks (**AAPL, GOOGL, META**).  

After every run, the model also **sends an email** with the prediction and confidence score.  
The next step will be to **automate daily runs** so predictions are delivered automatically.

## üöÄ Features
- Uses **LSTM** for time-series prediction  
- Considers **correlation with AAPL, GOOGL, META** along with NVDA history  
- Outputs **prediction direction (Up/Down)** and a **confidence score**  
- Sends **email notifications** after each run  
- Future work: **Automation for daily scheduled runs**

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras**

## ‚ö° How It Works
1. Collects historical stock prices for NVDA, AAPL, GOOGL, META  
2. Prepares time-series input for LSTM  
3. Trains the model to classify **Up or Down** for NVDA tomorrow  
4. Runs inference and outputs prediction with confidence  
5. Sends results via **email notification**

## üìß Email Notifications
- After each prediction run, you‚Äôll receive a **mail** with:  
  - Predicted direction (Up/Down)  
  - Confidence score (%)
